    "### Introducing System Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we briefly describe components that will come up throughout the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "*server*: hardware or software providing a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the *client*.\n",
    "oftentimes, it is a beefy machine. examples: database server, web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "*client*: a **user program** that connects to a server to access a service. an example is a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "*database*: **organized collection of data**, typically stored electronically in a computer system. can be divided into relational and non-relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*data warehouse*: central data repository for storing **structured data**. this is generally a collection of relational databases across an org.\n",
    "\n",
    "*data lake*: central data repository for **storing data of any structure**. the benefit is that unstructured and semi-structured data can be stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "*load balancer*: device to distribute a set of tasks over a set of resources (generally servers), to enable scale.  \n",
    "for example if a web server has traffic that overwhelms a server, a load balancer can be put in front of a set of servers.  \n",
    "the load balancer will send uniformly distributed data to the servers.\n"

    "\n",
    "*front end*: layer of a system that focuses on **visual aspects**, like the web site. typically UX people work on this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "*back end*: part of the system focused on structure, business logic and data. for example, the database resides in this part. \n",
    "\n",
    "*cloud solutions*: products and services offered by a *cloud provider* which offers pay-as-you-go pricing using their hardware and software.\n",
    "\n",
    "*cloud provider*: these companies maintain the hardware and software for customers to use. Currently, the most popular providers are:\n",

    "### Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "When more computing resources are needed, two approaches are *horizontal scaling* and *vertical scaling*.  \n",

    "*vertical scaling*: adding resources to the server, such as CPUs, RAM, DISK.  \n",
    "- can be relatively expensive\n",
    "- there are hardware limits to this scaling\n",
    "- the server is a single point of failure - if it goes down, the application goes down with it\n",

    "- cloud computing services make this easy\n",
    "- relatively inexpensive way to scale\n",

    "\n",
    "A **batch job** is a job run on a finite amount of data. This might consist of computing analytics or making a set of predictions.\n",

    "A **streaming job** runs on data that doesn't end. An example is processing data from a Twitter feed.\n",

    "1. design layer: front-end web site\n",

    "The tiles represent components specific to Amazon Web Services (AWS), so let's unpack them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- EC2 comprises servers or *instances* as they call them. There is a set or fleet of instances to support the web layer\n",
    "and a separate set to support the application layer. These fleets can be scaled (removing or adding instances) as the job size changes; this type of scaling is an example of horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amazon RDS is a relational database service. It is good practice to maintain one or more backups for redundancy.\n",
    "Read replicas are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amazon Route 53 is a DNS service that takes a web address like www.yahoo.com and maps it via a lookup table to its associated ip address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amazon S3 (simple storage service) is a data lake. Specifically it is an *object store* based on key-value pairs of data. This is a NoSQL database. It is very common to store all data in S3.\n",

    "Most data at rest currently lives in a relational database (consisting of tables that can be joined with common fields).\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-structured data (e.g., JSON) and unstructured data are often stored in NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is very popular for passing data between applications (APIs) due to its simple, hierarchical structure.\n",
